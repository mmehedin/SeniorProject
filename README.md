# Senior Project

Purpose: 
To learn about RNN and NLP. To compare the performance of RNN using character versus word based NLPs. 

Aims:
1. To learn python.
2. To learn natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
3. To learn about Tensor Flow and how to use it in the contex of NLP.
4. To learn to use TensorBoard. 
5. To apply RNN to character based text analysis. 
6. To apply RNN to word based text analysis. 
7. Collect preliminary data.
8. To develop a statistical model for predicting performance of RNN.
9. Preliminary analysis.
10. Revisit the model and apply to different sets of data.
